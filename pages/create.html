			To create a XMPP chatroom, the first thing you need is a XMPP account
			yourself so you can register and administrate a room. 
			Most often, you can just visit the XMPP server's website and create
			an account.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			For room administration, you should use an installed XMPP program (XMPP
			client, where "client" means a program you use to communicate to a server).
			A multimessenger (IM program where you can add several accounts like
			ICQ, XMPP/Jabber, GTalk, etc.) should be most useful here. 
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			After you've added your account in your messenger (<a class="xmpp webclient" href="https://is-a-furry.org/page/is-a-furry-chat-without-the-homepage/"
			target="_blank">here's a tutorial, works for other servers as well as for
			is-a-furry.org</a>), all you'll have to do
			is join a room. If no one yet registered it, you're moderator and can
			register it.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			As Pidgin (or it's Mac equivalent, Adium) is cross-platform and 
			popular, the following tutorial shows you how to create a XMPP
			multi user chatroom via Pidgin: <a class="xmpp webclient" href="https://itservices.stanford.edu/service/instantmessaging/pidgin/chat"
			target="_blank">itservices.stanford.edu</a>.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			Note you do not have to invite users via XMPP to let them join your room.
			Inviting like the tutorial describes is an option, but you can just tell
			people somewhere else of the room and <a class="xmpp webclient" href="./link.html" target="_blank">just create
			a link to let people join on click</a>.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			To adjust a rooms settings, you need to configure the room. In Pidgin, this works via
			typing "/config" in the message window after joining the room.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			If you want the room to remain (and you to remain admin there), make the room persistent.
			This is the only setting you "have" to do to register a room. Setting a room title sometimes
			creates trouble with some clients, so let it be if you don't have to. Description can stay
			empty as well, only set if you need it.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			A smaller room for more private  discussions should not be publically listed. When a room
			is publically listed, users on the server can read the room list and join a room of their
			likes, yours as well. If you want exactly that, make the room publically searchable. If not,
			uncheck this setting. The participant list being public should be unchecked as well in most
			cases.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			Room passwords sometimes make sense, but usually are not necessary. Use this option to keep
			annoying users out if you have a little troll problem. (If you are already using an encryption
			password and everyone is using this client, a room password should not be necessary - you won't
			see anything people on other clients and/ or not knowing the password write. You room password,
			if you set one and still use encryption, should never be the same as your encryption password,
			as the encryption password is known to the server.)
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			With these settings, your room is configured for use, with you as an admin.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			A (possible) problem that remains is <strong class="xmpp webclient">discussion history</strong>.
			XMPP rooms save discussion history. If users join, the discussion history remains even after
			everyone left the room. Whether discussion history is active, and how much is saved, usually depends
			on the server. "Last week's messages" isn't rare.
			<br>
			The webclient on this page is configured not to show discussion history. Still, many clients
			do. If you use an encryption password, people joining with other clients will only see
			encrypted clutter - until they decrypt it somehow else (knowing the password) 
			and read who said something unfriendly about them 
			etc. ;).
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			Some servers allow you to set the maximum number of messages to be shown to joining users.
			If this is available, you usually want to set the number of messages to zero.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			If setting the discussion history maximum shown to users is not possible, clear the room pretty
			often as an admin. In Pidgin, this is just a matter of typing "/clear" when logged in as
			admin.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			Please tell users that registered users can join unregistered rooms 
			(you'll notice a room is unregistered
			when the first who joins is moderator). Unregistered rooms usually don't 
			keep history, i.e. history is deleted after everyone left. 
			Via typing "/join roomname", users can join a room from
			the webclient (i.e. when chatting from this page). So if they'd like to discuss without their
			discussion appearing in room history, they can join a room together (or just do private chat if
			it's only two users). You could mention that in the message subject. Make sure if there
			are such settings that all users are allowed to do private chat.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			Note that if users are chatting via this website using an encryption password, all you'll
			see using another client is the usernames and encrypted nonsense instead of message text. Just
			don't care about that - room configuration and clearing the room still work. To see what users 
			write, and kick or ban trolls, the webinterface can easily be used. As usernames are not encrypted,
			you could as well use another client for all administrative tasks while joining in the chat on
			this page as a normal user.
			<br>
			When you ban users, be aware there usually is no "unban" in XMPP. Instead, invite the user to
			the room (as shown in the tutorial). This "unbans" them automatically.
