			This application allows you to join XMPP multi user chats (MUC)
			on a website. (XMPP/ Jabber is an instant messaging protocol that supports
			groupchats as well on some servers - you may know such groupchats from for
			example Skype, IRC or ICQ.)
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			To join one or several MUC rooms on a server of your choice,
			simply use <a href="./chat.html" target="_blank">the login
			form</a> (<a href="./chat.html#?lang=de" target="_blank">German version
			here</a>). At some servers, unregistered chatting is possible,
			while at others, you'll need an account.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			If you have a website, or want to share a room with several
			people easily, you should
			<a href="./pages/link.html" target="_blank">create an autojoin link</a>.
			You can specify server, theme and other details. Users will
			be greeted with either a nickname or a login form after 
			clicking the link. Autojoin links make sense as well if 
			joining some rooms very often.
		</p>
		<p class="xmpp webclient">
			The XMPP client on this page supports client side encryption,
			i.e. encrypting the messages in your browser using an encryption
			password, and decrypting other users' messages in the browser
			using this password as well. No one who does not know the
			password - not even the server, as the password is never sent
			anywhere - can read such encrypted messages. However, this only
			works if everyone in the conversation is using the XMPP client
			on this page.
